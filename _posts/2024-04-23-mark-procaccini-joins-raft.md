Washington, D.C., April 23, 2024 – Raft announced today Accenture alum Mark Procaccini has joined the company’s leadership team as senior vice president of operations, a new position at the digital consultancy. Procaccini will be responsible for scaling operations to support corporate growth after it secured its first major investment action last month.

“After spending my career supporting the scaling, selling and integration of companies large and small, I am excited to come aboard Raft because of its culture and competitive edge,” said Procaccini. “I look forward to partnering with Shubhi and her team to create operational excellence that supports Raft’s tenacious ‘get it done’ attitude.”

Procaccini’s experience in leading operations in high-growth government contracting companies will help Raft serve its growing customer set and solutions offerings to bring its data systems and platforms to new mission sets at scale.

Our culture is one that prioritizes collaboration, moving fast and operating on the edge with our customers,” said Shubhi Mishra, CEO of Raft. “His ability to harness chaos in the fast-changing digital realm of national security is going to help us ensure we deliver overmatch to our clients.”
